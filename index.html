      <p class="intro">One of my favorite trips I've taken was a two-week road trip across Utah, Arizona, and Wyoming in August of 2020 to the western national parks. The stunning natural beauty and panoramic views of the parks were absolutely incredible, and we even had the privilege of witnessing shooting stars that were (literally) out of this world. The highlight of the trip though was definitely getting engaged at the end of a long and sweaty hike at Zion National Park. Read below to see what this two-week trip entailed and maybe it will inspire you to venture out west!

      <p class="text-l">Our adventure began with a visit to Utah's Arches and Cayonland National Park, which also happened to be the hottest days of our trip. The heat was so intense that some of our camp spice containers melted in the sun! Despite the extreme temps, we decided to camp out under the stars at the <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/266144">Sand Flats Recreation Area</a> campground where we saw The Shooting Star&trade; and haven't been able to shut up about it since. Arches is an easy park to visit, but it can be quite crowded in the summertime, so be prepared to wait in line if you want to snap a photo in front of the iconic Delicate Arch.
    </p>
    <p class="text-l">Canyonlands is seriously underrated in my humble opinion. It may have been less crowded than Arches, but it made hiking highly enjoyable since we weren't fighting for spots to take in the views. We hiked the Grand View Point out-and-back trail and it was an awesome hike. I would recommend bringing plenty of water though if you decide to visit in the summertime! ☺</p>

      <p class="text-r">We continued our adventure through Arizona and took a small detour through Monument Valley. This Navajo Tribal Park is famous for its towering sandstone buttes that create a Mars-like landscape with its red and brown formations. We also made a short stop at Mexican Hat, one of Utah's strange rock formations. Despite the name, it doesn't really resemble a hat at all, rather a flat pancake. If you ever get a chance to travel through Arizona, these two destinations are super easy to get to and see.</p>

         <p class="text-l">In Arizona, we camped out at the Coral Pink Sand Dune State Park. This unique area is both a campground and off-road playground, making it a must-visit destination for thrill-seeking enthusiasts and outdoor lovers alike. Fun fact: it's the only major sand dune field on the Colorado Plateau. And the sunsets at this state park were just *chef's kiss.*
         </p>
         <p class="text-l">We managed to squeeze in a trip to Horseshoe Bend (also known as the east rim of the Grand Canyon) in the middle of our jam-packed schedule. Althrough it was brief stop and quite crowded, it was still worth it to see the view of the river.</p>

         <p class="text-r">Onward to one of the great wonders of the world, the Grand Canyon—the most magnificent landscape in all of the US. No matter where you look, the views of this natural wonder are breathtaking. However, if you're up for a challenge, there are some incredibly difficult hikes to tackle. During our visit, we hiked a four-mile in and out hike at the north rim and seaking as non-professional outdoor person, this was THE most strenous of all the hikes we did. The return uphill climb was particularly brutal. If you ever decide to hike here, please, please, please make sure your hiking boots have great ankle support.</p>
         <p class="text-r">The day after we hiked at Grand Canyon, we set our sights for Zion National Park. This park was super family-friendly offering a variety of trails catered to different hikers. One popular trail we really loved hiking was the Angel Landing Trail, which involved a steady incline with some switchbacks along the way (see <a href="https://www.eastzionadventures.com/blog/stairway-to-angels-landing-hiking-the-walters-wiggles-switchbacks/">Walter's Wiggles)</a>. Unfortunately <a href="https://www.zionponderosa.com/blog/2017/08/get-to-know-the-5-sections-of-angels-landing/">The Spine</a> was closed during early COVID, so we wern't able to traverse it. But honestly, as a person who is afraid of heights, I don't think I would have enjoyed it anyway! Angels Landing Trail is where Tristan and I got engaged, so I'd love to go back soon and revisit it sometime.</p>

               <p class="text-l">The last stops of our epic two-week adventure were Bryce Canyon and the Grand Teton National Park. It's at Bryce Canyon where we hiked the Fairyland Loop Trail that began at the northern portion of the park and took us through some amazing scenerary filled with hoodoos. It was the longest hike of the trip averaging about five hours from start to finish. We celebrated finishing the hike with some ice cream from their general store.  </p>
               <p class="text-l">And last but certainly not least, our two-week adventure ended in the great state of Wyoming at the Grand Teton National Park where the bears and wild animals are plentiful and so are the moutain views. Pro tip: if you go in late-August, most of the mosquitos have moved on. Or died. Or both. Either way, it's super pleasant if you're someone who attracts them.</p>
