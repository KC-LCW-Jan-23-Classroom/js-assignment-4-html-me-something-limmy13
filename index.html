         One of the BEST and most favorite trip I've ever taken was a two-week road trip to national parks across Utah, Arizona, and Wyoming in August of 2020. Not only did we get to see some breathtaking views (AND THE BEST SHOOTING STARS?!), but Zion National Park is near and dear to my heart, as my then-fianc&eacute;  proposed to me at the end of a very long and sweaty hike. Read below to see what this two-week trip entailed and prepare to be inspired to venture out west!

      <p class="text-l">Located in Utah, Arches and Cayondland National Park were the first stops in our trip and by far the hottest days. So hot, some of our camp spice containers melted in the sun! We stayed at the <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/266144">Sand Flats Recreation Area</a> campground where the night sky is unreal; we saw The Shooting Star&trade; and haven't been able to shut up about it since. Arches is fun but is one of the more popular parks, so be prepared to stand in line at the main arch if you want to get a photo in front of it. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-l">Canyonlands is a SLEEPER. I think it's the most underrated of all the western national parks, in my humble opinion. It was a little less busy than Arches, but the views were just as amazing. We hiked the Grand View Point out-and-back trail and it was highly enjoyable. Just bring lots of water with you if you decide to go in August. ☺</p>

      <p class="text-r">Next stop: Arizona! On our way to the next camping ground, we drove through Monument Valley, a Navajo Tribal Park, known for towering sandstone buttes on the Arizona-Utah border. We also stopped by Mexican Hat, one of Utah's strangest rock formations that doesn't really look like a hat at all. If you ever get a chance, these two destinations are easy to get to and see.</p>

         <p class="text-l">In Arizona, we stopped to see Horseshoe Bend AKA the "east rim of the Grand Canyon." It was a short stop, and a pretty busy and tourist-y area but worth it to see the views—just look at the colors reflecting off the river!
         </p>
         <p class="text-l">I still think about Coral Pink Sand Dune State Park to this day. It's a camp ground but also an off-road playground where you can run around the dunes. Fun fact: it's the only major sand dune field on the Colorado Plateau. The sunsets at this state park were just *chef's kiss.*</p>

         <p class="text-r">Onward to one of the great wonders of the world, the Grand Canyon—the most magnificent landscape in all of the US (IMO). There are no bad views of the Grand Canyon, but there are some incredibly hard hikes! We hiked two miles in and out at the north rim. This was probably the most strenous of all the hikes we did (speaking as a non-professional outdoor person), simply because going back uphill was b r u t a l. If you ever decide to hike here, make sure your hiking boots have great ankle support!</p>
         <p class="text-r">Zion is really a family-friendly national park. There are both easy and harder trails for different hikers. We really loved the Angel Landing Trail, which was mostly just a steady incline and some switchbacks the whole way up. (see <a href="https://www.eastzionadventures.com/blog/stairway-to-angels-landing-hiking-the-walters-wiggles-switchbacks/">Walter's Wiggles)</a>. We sadly didn't get to try <a href="https://www.zionponderosa.com/blog/2017/08/get-to-know-the-5-sections-of-angels-landing/">The Spine</a> as it was closed during early COVID. But honestly, as a person who is afraid of heights, I don't think I would have enjoyed it! This is where Tristan and I got engaged, so I'd love to go back soon and revisit this trail.</p>

               <p class="text-l">The last stops of our epic two-week adventure were Bryce Canyon and the Grand Teton National Park. It's at Bryce Canyon where we hiked the Fairyland Loop Trail that began at the northern portion of the park and took us through some amazing scenerary filled with hoodoos. It was the longest hike of the trip averaging about five hours from start to finish. We celebrated finishing the hike with some ice cream from their general store.  </p>
               <p class="text-l">And last but certainly not least, our trip ended in the great state of Wyoming at the Grand Teton National Park where the bears and wild animals are plentiful and so are the moutain views. Pro tip: if you go in late-August, most of the mosquitos have moved on. Or died. Or both. Either way, it's super pleasant if you're someone who attracts them.</p>
